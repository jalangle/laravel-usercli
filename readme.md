# LaraUserCLI

A set of artisan console commands for managing application users

- [Introduction](#introduction)

## Introduction
LaraUserCLI provides a set of console commands for managing application users.
These commands are loosely modeled on the unix user management
commands like adduser and deluser. I have grand dreams (though not enough time)
of fleshing out the entire tree of user/group management functionality.

Currently optionally looks for [Bouncer](https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer) for managing roles.
